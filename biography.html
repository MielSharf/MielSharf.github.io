<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
I recieved my Ph.D. from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://zelazo.net.technion.ac.il/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Daniel Zelazo</a> in the faculty of Aerospace Engineering.

My previous education is in theoretical mathematics. I recieved a B.Sc. (summa cum laude) and an M.Sc (magna cum laude) from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel. I was under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/uribader/home" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Uri Bader</a> during my M.Sc. 

</p>
<h2>Academic Experience</h2>
<p>
I am a postdoctoral researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am working with Prof. <a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Karl Henrik Johansson</a> on contract-based design for networked control systems. 
<br /><br />

I have recieved the Springer thesis award for my Ph.D. thesis on network optimization methods in passivity-based cooperative control.
I also won other international awards during my Ph.D. such as the IEEE Student Travel Award (2017) and the Designs Travel Award (2019). 
I also recieved some domestic awards, including the Dvorah and Professor Joseph Shinar Award (2018) and the Dov Shimshon Cohen award (2019); 
both are annual awards, given to one recipient for excellence in research in the field of aerospace engineering.
<br /><br />

I have previously served as a teaching assistant in the following courses:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foundations of Integrative Science 1&2 (Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel, 320097 and 320098)
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A research workshop intended for highly-skilled undergrads in the <a href="https://excellence.technion.ac.il/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Rothschild scholars program - Technion program for excellence</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I mentored and evaluated students&rsquo; projects.
</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>Special minicourse on Algebraic Representations of Ergodic Actions (University of Wroc&lstrok;aw, Poland)
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A series of lectures given by Prof. <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/uribader/home" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Uri Bader</a> on topics in the intersection of geometric group theory, ergodic theory and representation theory.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I gave a series of tutorial sessions on the presented topics, ranging from the Haar measure and the projective linear group to algebraic representation theory. You can see the tutorial sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0kt6UNwKzMhrF-GpV_g5UHFnFLUw5Fp" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a>.<br />

<h2>Other Experience</h2>
<p>
I have previously served in the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) as an algorithm developer and researcher as well as an engineer, as a part of the mandatory draft in Israel (2015-2020).
I have worked on real-time navigation and filtering, focusing on topics like cooperative navigation and GNSS ionospheric error compensation.
I have also worked on designing the architecture of the navigation module in multiple projects, integrating hardware and software, and conducting and analyzing experiments.
