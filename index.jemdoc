== About Me
~~~
I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. from the Faculty of Mathematics, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel in 2013 and 2016, respectively. My M.Sc. thesis was in the subject of geometric group theory, on understanding the action of groups on their horoboundary, and was supervised by Prof. [https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/uribader/home Uri Bader].

In 2020, I obtained a Ph.D. from the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. My Ph.D. thesis was on the subject of cooperative control of nonlinear systems using passivity and network optimization, and was supervised by Prof. [https://zelazo.net.technion.ac.il/ Daniel Zelazo] .

Since September 2020, I am a postdoctoral researcher at KTH, working with Prof. [https://people.kth.se/~kallej/ Karl Henrik Johansson] on contract-based design for networked control systems.
